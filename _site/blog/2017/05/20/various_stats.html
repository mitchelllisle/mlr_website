  <h1>ABS Census Data</h1>
<p class="meta">20 May 2017</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>Census data always provides some interesting stats about the state of Australia and our beliefs, interests and more. It’s a great way to play around with data and visualise some simple things about a particular topic</p>

<p>Note: Some of these maps may take a bit to load.
Note Note: All data is sourced from the Australia Bureau of Statistics, unless stated otherwise.</p>

<h4 id="population-by-suburb-2011">Population by Suburb (2011)</h4>
<p>You might not know how many people you share a suburb with, but the census has some really easy to use information on these numbers.</p>

<p>Future enhancement will be to show the population growth from one census to the next.</p>

<h4 id="most-common-household-income-by-suburb-2011">Most Common Household Income by Suburb (2011)</h4>
<p>Different areas are typically known for being more affluent or ‘bogan’ than others. But does the data reflect this opinion of the suburbs you can think of? Well, looking at household income is one way to do this. This represenation isn’t perfect, as it only shows the most common household income. But it does give an indication of where there are high concentrations of similar household incomes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The categories below show Weekly Income (E.g. $400 - 599) and Yearly Income in Brackets (E.g. $208,000 - $259,000)</li>
  <li>This is household income too, not individual income.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="most-common-religion-by-suburb">Most Common Religion by Suburb</h4>
<p>Driving around Australia you would notice a lot of different areas have different demographics, but one of the things that might be hard to notice is religions. You might see a church every now and then, but we have a diverse nation of religions and beliefs, and naturally some areas contain more people of one faith to another. This is a look at the most commonly occurring religions by suburbs.</p>

<h4 id="deaths-in-australia">Deaths in Australia</h4>
<p>A bit of a morbid one, but interesting nonetheless. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a> did an interesting article on <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/as-u-s-life-expectancies-climb-people-in-a-few-places-are-dying-younger/">life expectancy in the US</a>, and I thought it would be interesting to look at various stats related to <code class="highlighter-rouge">deaths in Australia.</code></p>
