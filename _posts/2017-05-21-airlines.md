#### Flights and Airlines (2017 to date)
Flying is one of those things that some you have to do alot of the time, but I don't particularly enjoy it, especially when there are problems. I don't have any particular loyalty when it comes to airlines, I do actively avoid some airlines based off past experience in delays/cancellations and the like. But how often do flights get delayed/cancelled?

Well, generally speaking, most airlines do pretty well when it comes to getting away on time, getting to their destination on time, and cancelling flights. Atleast for this year anyway. Stats below:

Next I'll look at getting some more data to see how this changes over time and any other data I can get around this.
